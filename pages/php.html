        <h3>autoloading</h3>
        <p>
          autoloading means php will load all the classes,interfaces,traits that
          is not included or in other word undefined.
        </p>
        <p>
          (spl_autoload_register(function($class) { // code })) this is a
          function that php run when you use a class that is not included in
          your current file before throwing an error.
        </p>
        <p>
          composer helping us in this by creating autoload.php file in vendor
          directory. So all you is include that file to your main project file.
          but it does no how to load user-defined classes. To solve this you
          need to add "autoload" object in compose.json file then inside it
          "psr-4" object. then you want to map the namespace of the class to the
          directory of that class. After that run "composer dump-autoload" in
          the terminal to regenerate the autoload files to include the ones that
          you added. (laravel do that for us using /artisan and
          /bootstrap/app.php)
