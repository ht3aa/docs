        <h2>IP Address:</h2>
        <p>
          IP addresses consist of 4 parts separated by dots and they are like
          phone numbers and there is 2 ways to write them:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>IPv4 (ex: 192.168.0.1)</li>
          <li>IPv6 (ex: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000: 8a2e:0370:7334)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The IPv4 old and common wheres IPv6 new and bigger. For now our
          documentation is for IPv4
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Types of IP Address:</h3>
        <p>There are 2 types of IP Address:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Privet IP Address (Not Unique and can't connect to the internet. In
            other words your device can't send data to the internet)
          </li>
          <li>Public IP Address (Unique and can connect to the internet)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The system goes like this: ISP (Internet service provider) will give
          your home router <strong>(default gateway)</strong> a public IP
          Address then your router will generate a privet IP addresses to the
          devices that are connected to it (This operation called DHCP). So when
          a device wants to send the data to the internet it will happened via
          the public IP address of the home router
          <strong>(default gateway)</strong>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          <strong class="note">Note: </strong>the total of the devices that can
          connect to the home router is 253 not 256 why? because the first IP
          address (ex:192.168.0.0) is the network IP address wheres the last IP
          address (ex:192.168.0.255) is the broadcast IP address (he will talk
          to everyone in the same network) and lastly the router IP address.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          <strong class="note">Note: </strong>127.0.0.0 is missing in the table.
          this IP address with subnet masking of 255.0.0.0 is for your network
          testing. (localhost?) in terminal ” ping 127.0.0.1 ” (ping means are
          you alive?)
        </p>

        <h2>subnet mask:</h2>
        <p>it's a tuff one so let's break it down</p>
        <ul>
          <li>in decimal format: 255.255.255.0</li>

          <ol>
            <li>
              255 => means the part that corresponding to IP address stay the
              same
            </li>
            <li>
              0 => means the part that corresponding to IP address are ranged
              from 0 to 255
            </li>
          </ol>

          <li>in binary format:11111111.11111111.11111111. 00000000</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              1 => means network bits (the part of the network that won't change
              and tells us which network we are in)
            </li>
            <li>0 => means host bits</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So if you want more hosts? add 0 instead of 1 (ex:
            11111111.11111111.11111100. 00000000)
          </p>
          <p>
            And if you want more networks? add 1 instead of 0 (ex:
            11111111.11111111.1111111. 11000000 "this give me 4 networks") the
            decimal format is 255.255.255.192 which give as 26 networks (numbers
            of 1). How many hosts in each networks? we will see the last network
            bit and convert it to decimal which will give as the increment
            number (The increment indicate how many hosts should each network
            have. In the case of example above the increment = 64) so network 1
            from 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.63. Network 2 192.168.1.64-192.168.1.127.
            Network 3 192.168.1.128-192.168.1.191. Network 4
            192.168.1.192-192.168.1.255
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >(This is subnetting. The practice of dividing a network into two
              or more networks is called subnetting.) how to do it in
              programming way? idk.</strong
