closures is a class so when you use anonymous functions it really implemented a new instance of closures class.


closures = anonymous function (anonymous function can use as a value or callable parameter).

// anonymous function as value
PHP automatically converts such expressions into instances of the Closure internal class
$showUsername = function($username) {
    return $username;
}


// anonymous function as callable parameter
$sayHello = function($username, callable $fn) {
	$usernameMod = $fn($username);
    $greeting = 'hello ' . $usernameMod;
    echo $greeting;
};

$sayHello('hassan', function($username) {
	return $username;
});

! think like that => $fn = function that implemented in the invoke call.
